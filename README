Authors: Charles Mitz, Jackie Wells, Christina Unkenholz, Henry Koontz

Instructions: Download zip or clone repository and ensure the running environment
has the necessary requirements located in requirements.txt. Run program.py file. 

Expected Behavior: Be aware it will likely take about a minute for experiment to 
complete. Upon completion, the aligned sequences will be saved in a sequences.fasta 
file, and probabilities.png will store the graphed posterior probabilities across 
the bases.
